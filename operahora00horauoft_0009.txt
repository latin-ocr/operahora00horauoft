Iris well known that the Roman Poets drew many of their imagen
from the workz of art, especially Greek, with which they were so familiar.
The design of this Volume is to put before the readers of Horace a few
good specimens of the source from which many of his expressions are
no doubt derived3 as well as to provide an Edition of a favour-ite Author,
with appropriate and sug-gentive embellishments.

'Phe Illustrations have been selected chiefly for the purpose of throwing
light upon the text, and the fe'w that have been ehosen for their own
artistic excellence will be found for the most part to illustrate allusions
in the Author.

'rho Text is printed from the eglitions of Mr. Maeleane, published in
the Bibliotheca Classica and Grammar School Classics. In the notes of
the former of these editions, some of the Illustrations in this volume are
nlluded to and explained.

The Drawings have been made by Mr. Î¤. D. Scott, and the Engravings
exeeuted under his superintendenee.

May, 1855.
